## Tinder swipe - Numbers game

##### Note: This project is for fun only ( and to help my fellow people who dont have time to swipe :P )

## Setup
- have [maven] installed
- have [java] installed
- Sign up tinder using ```Facebook``` only
- Make sure your tinder radius is setup based on your requirements. If matches ran out start over again
- I have covered most of the random tinder pop-ups condition to avoid interruption while swiping :P 


```In a good case if you keep it running for 24 hours you can swipe 43,200 people and all you have to do reply to people you like ... isn't it fun ? hahahaha```


## how to run
1. download the repo
2. goto inside folder from terminal e.g. cd LeftAndRight
3. Open the file : ```src/main/resources/user.properties```
4. add your email id e.g. hemantc09@gmail.com
3. add you password
4. Save the file user.properties. 
5. Now run the command below at root level where pom file is located.
   ``` mvn clean isntall```
6. Now seat back and enjoy the show

Contact: hemantc09@gmail.com for any questions. I will be happy to help.
